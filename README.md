The Lorenz system is a system of ordinary differential equations first studied by Edward Lorenz.
It is notable for having chaotic solutions for certain parameter values and initial conditions. 
In particular, the Lorenz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions of the Lorenz system which, when plotted,
resemble a butterfly or figure eight.
